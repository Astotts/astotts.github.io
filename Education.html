        <h1>CS 435 : Embedded Systems</h1><br><hr>
        Introduction to the high-level abstract modeling concepts and the lower-level fundamental programming aspects of real-time embedded systems development. The primary focus is in the design, development and validation of microprocessor-based real-time embedded systems. Course topics will include real-time operating system design, real-time scheduling theory, general-purpose microprocessors, common bus architectures, memory management, device driver development, interrupts, general purpose peripherals: such as timers and counters, I/O subsystems along with some embedded system design problems and engineering issues.<br><hr>

        <h1>CS 478 : Introduction to Deep Learning</h1><br><hr>
        Introduces use or application of software to cover fundamental topics of classification, regression and clustering, and a number of corresponding learning models such as the multi-layer perceptron and its gradient-based training through the backpropagation algorithm. Fully connected neural networks will be followed by more specialized neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (for images), recurrent neural networks (for sequences), and memory-augmented neural networks.<br><hr>
